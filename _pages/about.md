My name is Dawei Xiong, David. I am a first-year Computer Science Master student at the <a href = "https://cs.illinois.edu">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, where I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), focusing on the Electrical Engineering track.

Since September 2022, I have been involved in research at <a href="https://ghose.web.illinois.edu/students.html">ARCANA</a>, where I have worked on several projects(you can check on my CV). Right now I am working on my senior thesis on the reliability issues in Process-Using-Memory using off-the-shelf DRAM.

My research focus is on Computer Architecture, speficially on Process-Using-Memory using DRAM. I am open to other research projects of related fields.

In my spare time, I have a wide range of hobbies including motorsports (AutoCross) with my Elantra N. I am Big Fan of Formula1 supporting the <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/teams/Kick-Sauber.html">Stake Sauber team</a>. I do like trading & investment, option trading in particular. As a rooky trader, my trading strategy is to make profits while minizing loss, hedging risks at cost. Managing a delta-neutral portolio is a critical mathematical problem. Contact me if you like to share about your portfolio and your trading strategies. My girlfriend Jasmine and I have a pet hamster called Piler (because he likes to pile the bedding up all over him).
