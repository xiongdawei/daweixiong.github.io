My name is Dawei Xiong, but you can call me David. I am a first-year Master of Computer Science student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which is also where I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), focusing on the Electrical Engineering track.

Since September 2022, I have been involved in undergraduate research at ARCANA, where I have worked on several projects. These include designing the RACER simulator, integrating it with the Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST), and completing my senior thesis on the reliability issues in Process-Using-Memory systems.

My research focus is on Computer Architecture, speficially on Process-Using-Memory using DRAM. I am open to other research projects of related fields.

In my spare time, I have a wide range of hobbies including motorsports(AutoCross) with my Elantra N. Big Fan of Formula1 supporting the Stake Sauber team https://www.formula1.com/en/teams/Kick-Sauber.html. I do like trading & investment and I do like option trading. Contact me if you like to share about your portfolio and your trading strategies. My girlfriend Jasmine and I have a pet hamster called Piler (because he likes to pile the bedding up all over him).
